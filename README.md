# Analyzing Traffic on I-94
An elementary data science project demonstrating data cleaning and analysis of traffic patterns between Minneapolis and St. Paul on interstate-94.

## Conclusions
This project evaluated the 'Metro Interstate Traffic Volume' dataset for temporal and weather-based variations in traffic volume. Based on my evaluation of the data, traffic is heaviest in the following conditions:
* The morning (7a) and evening (4p) rush hours
* Warmer weather, specifically summer months
* Weekdays
* Transitional weather patterns, such as 'sleet' and 'mixed precipitation (snow/rain)'.

Traffic appears to be lightest in the following conditions:
* The middle of the night
* The middle of the day
* Weekends
* In squall weather conditions
